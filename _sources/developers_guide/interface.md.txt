# Interface Definition

Topwrap uses [interface definition files](interface.md#interface-definition) for its parsing functionality.

These are used to match a given set of signals that appear in the HDL source with signals in the interface definition.

{class}`~topwrap.interface.InterfaceDefinition` is defined as a {class}`marshmallow_dataclass.dataclass` - this enables loading the YAML structure into Python objects and performs validation (that the YAML is in the correct format) and typechecking (that the loaded values are of the correct types).

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: topwrap.interface.InterfaceDefinition
   :members:

```

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: topwrap.interface.get_interface_by_name
```
