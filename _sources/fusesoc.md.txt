# Using FuseSoC for automation

Topwrap uses the [FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) package manager and build tools for HDL code to automate project generation and the build process. When `topwrap build` is used with the `--fuse` option, it generates a [FuseSoC `.core` file](https://fusesoc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/overview.html#fusesoc-s-basic-building-block-cores) along with the top-level wrapper.

## Default tool for synthesis, bitstream generation and programming the FPGA

Topwrap assumes that you're using [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html). You can change the default tool to something other than Vivado by modifying the generated `.core` file.

## Additional build options

To enable `.core` file generation, supply the `--fuse`/`-f` flag to `Topwrap build`:

```bash
topwrap build -d design.yaml --fuse
```

If you have any additional directories with HDL sources or constraint files required for synthesis, you can specify them using the `--sources`/`-s` option.
Sources from these directories get appended to the `filesets.rtl.files` entry in the generated FuseSoC `.core` file.

```bash
topwrap build -d design.yaml -f --sources ./srcs_v -s ./srcs_vhd
```

If you're targeting a specific FPGA chip, you can additionally specify its number using the `--part`/`-p` option.

The supplied part number is passed to the FuseSoC `.core` file. It is included in the `targets.default.tools.vivado.part` entry, which is then supplied to [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) when you run FuseSoC and use the default target. This can be any part number available to your local Vivado installation.

```bash
topwrap build -d design.yaml -f --part 'xc7z020clg400-3'
```

## `.core` file template

A [template](https://github.com/antmicro/topwrap/blob/main/topwrap/templates/core.yaml.j2) for the `.core` file is bundled with Topwrap (`templates/core.yaml.j2`).

By default, {class}`topwrap.fuse_helper.FuseSocBuilder` searches for the template file in working directory, meaning you must copy the template file into the project location. You may also need to edit the file to change the backend tool, add more targets, set additional `Hooks` and edit other parameters.

## Synthesis

After generating the `.core` file, you can run FuseSoC to generate the bitstream and program the FPGA:

```bash
fusesoc --cores-root build run {design_name}
```

This requires having a suitable backend tool that is specified in the `.core` file under `targets.default.tools` available in your `PATH` (e.g. [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html)).
