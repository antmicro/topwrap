# Interconnect generation

Interconnects enable the connection of multiple interfaces in a many-to-many topology, as opposed to the traditional one-to-one manager-subordinate connection. This approach facilitates data transmission between multiple IP cores over a single interface, with the interconnect serving as an middle-man.

:::{warning}
Interconnect generation is an experimental feature.

Currently, creating and showing them is not possible in the Topwrap GUI.
:::

Each manager can communicate with any subordinate connected to the interconnect. Every connected subordinate must be assigned a predefined address range, allowing the interconnect to route data based on the address specified by the manager.

A typical interconnect topology diagram is shown below.

In order to generate an interconnect, you have to describe its configuration in the [Design description](description_files.md#design-description) under the `interconnects` key in the following format, as specified below:

## Format

The `interconnects` key must be a direct descendant of the `design` key in the [Design description](description_files.md#design-description).

```yaml
interconnects:
  {interconnect1_name}:
    # Specify clock and reset to drive the interconnect with
    clock: [{ip_name, clk_port_name}]
    reset: [{ip_name, rst_port_name}]
    # Alternatively you can specify a connection to an external port of this design:
    # clock: ext_clk_port_name
    # reset: ext_rst_port_name

    # Specify the interconnect type.
    # See the "Supported interconnect types" section below for available types
    # and their characteristics
    type: {interconnect_type}

    # custom parameter values for the specific interconnect type
    parameters:
      {parameters_name1}: parameters_value1
      ...

    # specify managers and their interfaces connected to the bus
    managers:
      {manager1_name}:
        - {manager1_interface1_name}
        ...
      ...

    # specify subordinates, their interfaces connected to the bus and their bus parameters
    subordinates:
      {subordinate1_name}:
        {subordinate1_interface1_name}:
          # requests in address range [address, address+size) will be routed to this interface
          address: {start_address}
          size: {range_size}
        ...
      ...
  ...
```

## Supported interconnect types

### `Wishbone Round-Robin`

This interconnect only supports Wishbone interfaces for managers and subordinates.
It supports multiple managers, but only one of them can drive the bus at a time (i.e. only one transaction can be happening on the bus at any given moment).
A round-robin arbiter decides which manager can currently drive the bus.

#### Parameters

- `addr_width` - bit width of the address line (addresses access `data_width`-sized chunks)
- `data_width` - bit width of the data line
- `granularity` - access granularity - the smallest unit of data transfer that the interconnect can transfer. Must be: 8, 16, 32, 64
- `features` - optional, list of optional wishbone signals, can contain: `err`, `rty`, `stall`, `lock`, `cti`, `bte`

#### Known limitations

The currently known limitations are:

- only word-sized addressing is supported (in other words - consecutive addresses can only access word-sized chunks of data)
- crossing clock domains, down-converting (initiating multiple transactions on a narrow bus per one transaction on a wider bus) and up-converting are not supported
